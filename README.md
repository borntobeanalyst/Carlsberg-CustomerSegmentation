# Carlsberg-Customer Segmentation

This project belonged to London Business School London LAB 2020 programme which fostered cooperative projects between students and international corporations. 

Our team partnered with Carlsberg, a Danish international brewer founded in 1847, which requested a data consulting with its real-time beer consumption data. Carlsberg group has launched new digital draughtmaster system to track the consumption of the beer of their own brands in different locations. Hereby, I only used the data of Italian outlets served by Carlsberg group to discover the newest customer segmentations and following customer acquisition strategy.

Since I can't expose the details of the dataset itself, I did not upload the original csv file and just shared the code to help you get the idea of the clustering methods (PAM) and the recommendation & prediction (lstm) algorithm using python with real-time data.
